"The Fedora community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers"
" from all over the world, working on every aspect of the distribution from "
"coding through to marketing. Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it "
"can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have "
"a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they're using "
"project resources."

"Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no"

"feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the "

"Fedora."
